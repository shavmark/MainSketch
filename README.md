# MainSketch
This is an OpenFrameworks .9 and Kinect 2.0 SDK based project, both need to be installed and OpenFramworks needs to be in the Visual Studio 2015 soltuion.

Examples used from https://github.com/elliotwoods and https://github.com/UnaNancyOwen I found  its best to make a simple and direct solution vs. trying to tie other projects together as the Kinect is touchy and any abstraction seems to cause very subtle issues that take a bit of work to track down.

I also found the Kinect face code worked better than any code I could run form OpenCV and a HD camera, and its much (much) less code to deal with.  

NuiDatabase is required for face tracking, https://github.com/Kinect/Docs/blob/master/Kinect4Windows2.0/k4w2/Programming_Guide/Face_tracking.md.
