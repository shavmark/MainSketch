# MainSketch
This is an OpenFrameworks .9 and Kinect 2.0 SDK based project.

Examples used from https://github.com/elliotwoods and https://github.com/UnaNancyOwen.I found  its best to make a simple and direct solution vs. trying to tie other projects together as the Kinect is touchy and any abstraction seems to cause very subtle issues that take a bit of work to track down.

I also found the Kinect face code worked better than any code I could run form OpenCV and a HD camera, and its much (much) less code to deal with.
