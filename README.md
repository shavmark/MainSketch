# MainSketch
This is an OpenFrameworks .9 and Kinect 2.0 SDK based project.

Examples used from ElliotWoods ofxKinetForWindows2, http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~edwardz/tutorials/kinect2/kinect0_sdl.html, https://github.com/UnaNancyOwen.  I found that its best to make a simple and direct solution vs. trying to tie other projects together as the Kinect is touchy and any abstraction seems to cause very subtle issues.

I also found the Kinect face code worked better than any code I could run form OpenCV, and its much (much) less code to deal with.  Just an observation I am am sure I missed some key things.
